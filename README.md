## Significance

*pytop* is an **extended FEniCS** for general-purpose optimization in finite element space, including topology optimization. This software provides straightforward coding for complex optimization problems.
This software uses the [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) as a finite element solver and [NLopt](https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt) as an optimization solver.

> This software is the independent module of fenics and nlopt project.

> This software is based on Lagacy FEniCS (FEniCS2019.1.0). The new version, FEniCSx, is not supported.

## Documentation
Documentation with many physics is available here:

## Introduction

Topology optimization is a common method for designing physic-objective-oriented structures. *pytop* enables straightforward Pythonic coding for high-performance
topology optimization. This software works with any general objective, physics, and (inequality) constraints, with automatic derivative.

## Hands-on

We provide a container for this repository. The container includes python 3.11, FEniCS bundles, and NLOpt with python interface.
The container is avaiable in [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ichiharanaruki/pytop/general).
To try out this repository, connect to the codespace with the following:

## Usage
### Import pytop
First, you need to import *pytop* by standard Python style:
```python
import pytop as pt
```
In the header of pytop, all methods and classes of FEniCS will be imported if FEniCS was collectively installed. So, all methods in FEniCS can be called directly like:
```python
...
U = pt.FunctionSoace(mesh, "CG", 1)
u = pt.Function(U)
...
```
Please refer to the [FEniCS document](https://fenicsproject.org/) to use fundamental functions in FEniCS.
### Mesh
Second, you need to generate (or import) mesh. This software provides easy method to import external mesh, `import_external_mesh`. This method use `meshio` in the backgroud, so any mesh type that supported by [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) is supported.
```python
mesh = pt.import_external_mesh(path_to_the_meshfile)
```
Of course, you can generate mesh by built-in mesh generator in FEniCS like as:
```python
NUMBER_OF_NODES = (100, 100)
POSITION = (100, 100)
mesh = pt.RectangleMesh(pt Point(0, 0), pt.Point(*POSITION), *NUMBER_OF_NODES)
```
Moreover, we provide simple interface of [pygmsh](https://github.com/nschloe/pygmsh). pygmsh can generate more flexible geometry, whether 2D or 3D.
```python
import pytop as pt
import pygmsh

...
mesh = pt.from_pygmsh(pyg_mesh)
```

### Function space and Function
This is standard procedure in the FEniCS. You first need to define `FunctionSpace` and then `Function` (If need, `TrialFunction` and `TestFunction`).
```python
U = pt.VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, 'CG', 1) #1st order continuous Galerkin vector space
uh = pf.Function(U, name='displacement)
u = pt.TrialFunction(U)
du = pt.TestFunction(U)
```

### Boundary Condition
This is also standard procedure in the FEniCS. To define sub-domain of mesh, `pt.SubDomain` class is useful.
```python
class Left(pt.SubDomain):
    def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
        return x[0] < 1e-6 and on_boundary

bc = pt.DirichletBC(U, pt.Constant((0, 0)), Left())
```
This restricts the left side boundary (x[0] < 1e-6) zero displacement.
To apply Noiman boundary condition, you can use useful method `make_noiman_boundary_domains`.
```python
class Loading(pt.SubDomain):
    def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
        reurn x[0] > 200-1e-6 and 45.0 < x[1] < 55.0 and on_boundary
    
ds = pt.make_noiman_boundary_domains(mesh, [Loading()], True)
```
This function returns `Measure` class, `ds`.

### Design variable
You need to define design variable before optimization. The `DesignVariables` class can store multiple design variables with their function space, name, initial value, range, pre/post process, recording path, and recording parameter.
```python
X = pt.FunctionSpace(mesh, 'CG', 1)
design_variables = pt.DesignVariables()
design_variables.register(X,
                          "parameter_name",
                          [initial value],
                          [range],
                          lambda x: some pre process,
                          lambda x: some post process,
                          "recording_path",
                          recording_interval)
```
### Problem definition
The problem statement can be constructed with `ProblemStatement`.
```python
# pytop.physics module includes useful utilities to define physics.
from pytop.physics import elasticity as el

class Elasticity_Problem(pt.ProblemStatement):
  # objective is abstruct method that must be defined.
ã€€# In this, you need to define physics problem and return evaluation value.
    def objective(self, design_variables): 
        self.rho = design_variables["density"] # You need to access design variables through design_variables.
        a = el.linear_2D_elasticity_bilinear_form(u, du, E, nu, penalized_weight(self.rho, eps=1e-4)) # Bilinear form for 2D elastic problem
        L = pt.inner(f, du) * ds(1)  # ds(1) means first subdomain that defined by make_noiman_boundary_domains method.
        pt.solve(a == L, uh, bc)
        return pt.assemble(pt.inner(f, uh) * ds(1))
    # methods that start with "constraint_" is inequality constraint (x<=0).
    def constraint_volume(self, design_variables):
        unitary = pt.project(pt.Constant(1), X)
        return pt.assemble(self.rho*pt.dx)/pt.assemble(unitary*pt.dx) - TARGET_DENSITY
```

### Optimizer
`NloptOptimizer` will construct NLopt `opt` class with `DesignVariables` and `ProblemStatement`. 
```python
opt = pt.NloptOptimizer(design_variables, Problem(), "LD_MMA")
# LD_MMA means Method of moving asymptotes.
```
Then you set parameter of optimizer by nlopt optimizer class methods.
Please refer avaiable method in [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Python_Reference/).
For example, here we set to maximum iteration number is 300, and relative tolerance is 1e-4:
```python
opt.set_maxeval(300)
opt.set_ftol_rel(1e-4)
```
Then optimization will start by calling `run` method.
```python
opt.run(path_for_data_logging)
```
## Tips
### MPI parallelization
This software is designed as parallelization-ready. Problem is automatically divided into partial problems and computed in each cpus. We provide useful detaclass for MPI, `MPI_Communicator`. You can construct a mpi group use this class,
```python
import pytop as pt
comm_group = pt.MPI_Communicator.comm_world
```
Single problem must be in the same group. Then,`mpirun` executes the solving with cpus you mentioned:
```bash
mpirun -n 36 python your_problem.py
```
In the container, you need to give option to allow run as a root user:
```bash
mpirun -n 36 --allow-run-as-root python your_problem.py
```
Above example use 36 cpus. 

### Working with pygmsh
You can use ```pygmsh``` as mesh generator.
Documentation of ```pygmsh``` is available [here](https://pygmsh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
```python
import pytop as pt
import pygmsh

with pygmsh.geo.Geometry() as geom:
    lcar = 0.1
    p1 = geom.add_point([0.0, 0.0], lcar)
    p2 = geom.add_point([1.0, 0.0], lcar)
    p3 = geom.add_point([1.0, 0.5], lcar)
    p4 = geom.add_point([1.0, 1.0], lcar)
    s1 = geom.add_bspline([p1, p2, p3, p4])

    p2 = geom.add_point([0.0, 1.0], lcar)
    p3 = geom.add_point([0.5, 1.0], lcar)
    s2 = geom.add_spline([p4, p3, p2, p1])

    ll = geom.add_curve_loop([s1, s2])
    pl = geom.add_plane_surface(ll)

    mesh = geom.generate_mesh()

mesh = pt.from_pygmsh(mesh)
```

Use ```planation``` option is used, all ```z``` coordinates will be neglected.
```python
mesh = pt.from_pygmsh(mesh, planation=True)
```
