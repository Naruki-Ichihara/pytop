## Significance

*pytop* is a library for the general purpose optimization in finite element space, including topology optimization. *pytop* provides secure, safe, and straightforward coding for complex optimization problems.
*pytop* uses the [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) for finite element solver and [NLopt](https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt) as a optimization solver.

> *pytop* is the indipendent module of fenics and nlopt project.

> This software is based on Lagacy FEniCS (FEniCS2019.1.0). The new version, FEniCSx, is not supported.
